## Text

The Johnson family, residing in the quaint town of Bath, England, had long cherished the tradition of spending Christmas amidst the biting cold and the familiar Carol services. However, this year was going to be different. The family — comprised of Sarah and Mark, along with their two teenage children, Emily and James — had decided to trade their usual frosty celebration for a warmer, more vibrant one in sunny Spain.

The decision wasn’t made on a whim. Over the past few years, Mark had been struggling with recurring bouts of seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression that tends to occur during the winter months. "It's as if the cold seeps into my very bones," he would often remark as the days grew shorter. This winter, Sarah, who had seen her husband’s brighter demeanor after their summer holidays in Spain, suggested a change of scenery to lift his spirits.

Their Spanish escape plan was also motivated by Emily’s passion for flamenco dancing. She had recently taken a keen interest in the art form and was eager to witness it in its cultural context. The family, therefore, chose Seville, not only for its mild climate but also for its rich traditions and festive atmosphere.

Upon their arrival in Seville, the Johnsons were engulfed by its vibrant Christmas markets and the enchanting glow of lights that adorned the city streets. They found themselves enchanted by the local customs, like the "Nochebuena" feast and the intricate nativity scenes, known as "belénes." The highlight of their trip was a mesmerizing flamenco performance in a quaint tavern, where Emily was even invited to join in, much to her delight.

The Johnsons' Spanish Christmas turned out to be a heartwarming experience that infused them with joy and togetherness. It was a departure from their norm, but one that left them richer in spirit and with a treasure trove of memories. As they watched the sunset over the Guadalquivir River on Christmas Eve, they realized that sometimes, embracing the unexpected can lead to the most fulfilling experiences.
