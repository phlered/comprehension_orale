## Text

Hi! My name is Emily, and I am from a small town in the Midwest, USA. I am excited to be your pen pal. I live in the countryside with my family. My family is big: I have two brothers and one sister. We also have a dog named Max.

In my free time, I love to read books. My favorite books are about adventures and mysteries. I also enjoy playing soccer with my friends. On weekends, my family and I go for long walks in the nearby forest. 

Living in the Midwest has many good things. The nature is beautiful, and the people are friendly. I like the fresh air and the open spaces. But sometimes, I wish there were more things to do. We don't have many shops or places to go out, so it can be a little boring.

I hope you enjoyed learning about me. I am excited to hear about you and your life.
