Every Sunday, my family and I have dinner at Grandma’s house. It’s a tradition we all love and look forward to each week. Grandma lives just a short drive away, in a charming little house with a beautiful garden full of flowers. As soon as we arrive, the smell of delicious food fills the air, welcoming us inside.

Grandma always prepares a big meal with lots of different dishes. There is always roasted chicken, mashed potatoes, fresh salad, and her famous homemade apple pie for dessert. The table is beautifully set with her best plates and a vase of fresh flowers from her garden.  

Before dinner, we all sit in the living room and catch up. Grandma loves to hear about our week—our school, work, and any special events. She tells us stories about her younger days, too, which are always fun and interesting. She has a great sense of humor, and we all laugh a lot.

When dinner is ready, we gather around the table. We say a short prayer and then start eating. The food is always amazing, and we all thank Grandma for her hard work. As we eat, we share stories, talk about movies, books, and sometimes plan our next family trip. It’s nice to spend quality time with everyone.

After dinner, we help Grandma clean up. She insists we sit and relax, but we like to help. Once the kitchen is tidy, we usually play a board game or watch a family movie together.

Sunday dinners at Grandma's are special and create wonderful memories. They remind me how important family is and how lucky I am to have them.
