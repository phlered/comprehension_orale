## Text

Hello! My name is Tom, and I am from the Devon countryside in England. I am 14 years old. I want to tell you about my life, my family, and my hobbies.

In my family, there are four people. My dad, John, is a farmer. He works with cows and sheep. My mom, Sarah, is a teacher in our village school. I have one sister, Emily. She is 10 years old and loves to draw.

We live in a big, old house. The garden is very beautiful. We have flowers, trees, and even a small pond. I like to play in the garden with my sister.

In my free time, I have many hobbies. I love playing football with my friends. We play every Saturday. I also enjoy reading books. My favorite books are about adventures and mysteries. Sometimes, I help my dad on the farm. I like feeding the animals and riding the tractor.

Living in the countryside is nice and peaceful. The air is fresh, and there are many green fields and hills. We have a small village near our house with a shop, a post office, and a park. I like going to the park to play and meet my friends.

I hope you enjoyed learning about me and my life in Devon.
