## Text

My name is Emily and I am 16 years old. I go to Riverdale High School. I am in 11th grade. I like my school. It is big and has many classrooms. My favorite subjects are English and art. I like reading stories and writing essays in English class. In art class, I can draw and paint. It is fun!

Every day, I wake up at 7:00 a.m. and eat breakfast. Then, I walk to the bus stop with my brother. The school bus arrives at 7:30 a.m. My classes start at 8:00 a.m. I have five classes every day. We have a break at 10:30 a.m. I talk with my friends and eat a snack.

Lunchtime is at 12:00 p.m. I usually eat a sandwich and fruit. Sometimes, I eat with my best friend, Sarah. After lunch, I have two more classes. School ends at 3:00 p.m. After school, I do my homework at home.

I also play volleyball. I am in the school team. We have practice on Wednesday and Friday. We have games on Saturday. I enjoy playing volleyball with my team. It keeps me active and happy.

This is my high school life. I enjoy learning new things and spending time with my friends. School is an important part of my life.
