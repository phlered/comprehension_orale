## Text

Christmas in the United States is a vibrant blend of customs that reflect the country's cultural diversity. One notable tradition is the widespread practice of decorating homes with elaborate light displays, sometimes turning entire neighborhoods into dazzling spectacles. This contrasts with the UK, where decorations tend to be more subdued and focused on interior spaces.

Americans also place great emphasis on Christmas movies and music, with classics like "Home Alone" and songs such as "Jingle Bell Rock" becoming an integral part of the holiday season. Meanwhile, in the UK, the focus is often on the Queen's (or now King’s) Christmas Speech, a royal tradition that is less emphasized in the U.S.

Furthermore, while both countries enjoy festive meals, the culinary focus differs. In the U.S., glazed ham or roast turkey often takes center stage, accompanied by sweet potato casserole and cranberry sauce. In contrast, British tables are famous for featuring roast turkey with trimmings like pigs in blankets and Christmas pudding. These differences highlight the unique ways in which each culture celebrates this beloved holiday.
