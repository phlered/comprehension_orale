## Text

Climate change is a big problem in our world today. It affects our daily life in many ways. The weather is changing. In some places, it is hotter than before. In other places, it rains more, and floods happen. These changes make life hard for people.

We can see climate change at home, too. In the summer, we need to use air conditioning more because it is very hot. This uses a lot of electricity. In winter, the weather can be strange. Sometimes it is cold, and other times it is warm. It is not easy to know how to dress.

Climate change also affects our food. Farmers have trouble growing crops because of too much rain or heat. This means food can be more expensive at the store.

We can help stop climate change by changing small things in our daily life. We can turn off lights when we do not need them. We can walk or ride a bike instead of driving a car for short trips. Recycling is also important. We can recycle paper, cans, and bottles. 

Every small action helps. If everyone tries, we can make the world a better place. It is important for us and for future generations.
