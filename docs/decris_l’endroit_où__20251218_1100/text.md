## Text

I live in a small apartment in the city. My apartment has two rooms. There is a bedroom and a living room. The bedroom is not big, but it is cozy. I have a bed, a desk, and a chair in my bedroom. I like to read books there. The living room is bright. There is a sofa, a small table, and a TV. I watch TV and relax in the living room. 

The kitchen is next to the living room. It is small but clean. I cook dinner there every evening. My bathroom is also small. It has a shower, a toilet, and a sink. 

My neighborhood is nice. There is a park near my apartment. I walk there with my friends. There is also a supermarket and a café. I go to the café on weekends. I like my home and my neighborhood very much. They are simple, but I am happy here.
