Hello! My name is Emily, and I am your new pen pal from the United States. I live in a small town in the Midwest. The Midwest is full of farms and beautiful nature. I live here with my family. We have a small house with a big garden. I live with my parents, my brother, and my dog, Max. My brother's name is Jack. He is 12 years old. I am 14 years old.

In my free time, I love to read books. My favorite books are mysteries. I also enjoy playing soccer with my friends. We play every Saturday at the park. Sometimes, my mom and I bake cookies together. It's fun, and the cookies are delicious.

Life in the Midwest is quiet and peaceful. I like the fresh air and the green fields. There is a lake near my house, and I enjoy going there for picnics with my family. It's very relaxing.

However, there are some things I don't like. Sometimes, it can be boring because there are not many shops or cinemas nearby. But overall, I am happy to live here. I hope to hear from you soon. Tell me about your life in your country!

Best wishes,

Emily
