## Text

Hello! My name is James, and I am a high school student in London. I want to tell you about my hobbies, my family, and my favorite places in my city. 

In my free time, I love to play football with my friends. We often play in the park near my house. I also enjoy reading books, especially adventure stories. Sometimes, I play video games, but not too much because I have to study.

I live with my family in a small house. My mom is a nurse, and she works at the hospital. My dad is a teacher at a nearby school. I have a younger sister named Emily. She is 10 years old and very funny. We like to watch movies together.

London is a big city with many interesting places. My favorite place is the British Museum. I like to see the old objects and learn about history. I also enjoy visiting Hyde Park. It is a nice place to relax and have a picnic. Sometimes, we see ducks and birds there.

On weekends, my friends and I like to go to the Science Museum. It is very exciting because we can try different experiments and learn new things. London is a wonderful city with so much to explore!
