Hello! My name is Emily, and I am 16 years old. I go to high school. I like my school because I have many friends here. Every day, I wake up early to go to school. My favorite subjects are English and art. I enjoy reading stories and drawing pictures. During lunch, I eat with my friends in the cafeteria. Sometimes, we talk about our favorite movies and music. After school, I often do my homework and study for tests. I also like to play basketball with my classmates. High school is fun, and I learn a lot every day.
