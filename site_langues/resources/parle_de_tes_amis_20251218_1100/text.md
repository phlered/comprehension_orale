## Text

I have three best friends. Their names are Anna, Tom, and Lisa. We are in the same class at school. We like to play and have fun together. After school, we often go to the park. We play football and sometimes we ride our bikes. 

Anna likes to paint. She paints very well. Tom loves sports. He runs fast and likes to play basketball. Lisa likes to read books. She tells us many stories. 

On weekends, we go to the cinema or have a picnic. We all enjoy watching movies, especially cartoons. We also like to eat ice cream. Chocolate is our favorite flavor. 

Sometimes, we do homework together. It is more fun with friends. We help each other if something is hard. 

I am happy to have good friends. We have a lot of fun and share nice moments. Friends are important!
