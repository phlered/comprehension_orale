One of my favorite things to do on a rainy day is to look through our family photo album. It's like a treasure chest full of memories. The album is old and a bit worn out, but every page tells a story. It starts with photos from my grandparents' wedding. They look so young and happy, surrounded by friends and family. I love imagining what their lives were like back then.

As I flip through the pages, I see pictures of my parents, my brother, and me. There’s a funny photo of my brother and me making silly faces during a family vacation at the beach. I remember that day well; we built a huge sandcastle and were very proud of it. There’s also a photo of our first family dog, Rocky, who was always full of energy and loved playing with us in the backyard.

One of the most special photos is of my grandmother and me baking cookies together. I can almost smell the sweet aroma from that day. She taught me her secret recipe, which I still use today. In the back of the album, there are newer photos from last year’s family reunion. It was amazing to see all our relatives, some of whom I hadn't seen in years.

Looking through the album makes me grateful for my family. Each photo is a reminder of the love and joy we share, despite the occasional ups and downs. It's a wonderful way to remember the past and cherish the moments we've had together.
