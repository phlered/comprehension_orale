Hello! My name is Alex. After school, I like to have fun. I have many hobbies. I love to play soccer with my friends. We play in the park. Soccer is fun, and I like to run. 

I also enjoy reading books. My favorite books are about animals. I like to learn new things. Sometimes, I read with my little sister. It is nice to share stories.

I like to listen to music, too. My favorite music is pop. I listen to music in my room. It makes me happy and I like to dance.

On weekends, I ride my bike. The weather is often nice. I ride my bike in the neighborhood. It is good exercise.

After dinner, I play video games. I play games with my brother. We like games with cars. It is exciting.

These are my hobbies. I enjoy my activities after school. They make me happy. What do you like to do?
