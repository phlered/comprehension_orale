## Text

The Thompson family, hailing from the quaint town of Stratford-upon-Avon, decided to break away from their traditional yuletide celebrations by spending Christmas in the sun-drenched landscapes of Spain. The decision was prompted by a blend of curiosity and a yearning for change. With the matriarch, Margaret, recently retiring, she expressed a desire to embrace new experiences and cultures beyond the familiar frosty mornings of England. Her son, James, a history enthusiast, was captivated by the idea of exploring Spain's rich historical tapestry, from the Moorish architecture of the Alhambra to the bustling streets of Barcelona. Furthermore, the family was eager to escape the mid-winter gloom, longing for the rejuvenating warmth of the Spanish sun. They envisioned exchanging mulled wine for sangria, and mince pies for churros dipped in chocolate. This adventure, they hoped, would not only reinvigorate their festive spirit but also strengthen their familial bonds through shared discoveries and joyous laughter in a land where oranges, rather than snow, adorned the trees.
