## Text

My name is Emily, and I am 16 years old. I am in high school. I like my school because I have many friends there. My favorite subject is English because I love reading and writing stories. I also enjoy playing sports, especially basketball. Every day, I learn new things in my classes. Some subjects are hard, like math, but I always try my best. My teachers are nice and help us when we have questions. After school, I join the drama club. We are preparing a play for next month. High school life is busy, but it is fun and exciting!
