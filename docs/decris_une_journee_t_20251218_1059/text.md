## Text

Here is a simple text in English about a typical day:

My name is Anna. I live in a small town. Every day, I wake up at 7:00 in the morning. I wash my face and brush my teeth. Then, I have breakfast. I eat bread and drink milk. After breakfast, I go to school. I walk to school with my friend, Lisa. School starts at 8:30. I like math and English. 

In the afternoon, I finish school at 3:00. I go home and have lunch with my family. We eat rice and vegetables. After lunch, I do my homework. Sometimes, I play with my dog in the garden. I also like to draw and read books.

In the evening, my family and I have dinner at 7:00. We eat together and talk about our day. After dinner, I watch TV or play games. At 9:30, I go to bed. I sleep well and dream about a new day.
