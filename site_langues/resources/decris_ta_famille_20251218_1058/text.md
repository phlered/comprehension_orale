## Text

My family is small but special. I have a mother, a father, and one sister. My mother’s name is Anna. She is kind and loves to cook. My father’s name is John. He works in an office. He likes to read books in the evening. My sister’s name is Lily. She is twelve years old, and she is very smart. She helps me with my homework.

I like to spend time with my sister. We play games and watch cartoons together. On weekends, we go to the park. We like to play on the swings and eat ice cream. Sometimes, my mother joins us. We have picnics and bring sandwiches.

In the evenings, my family sits together for dinner. After dinner, we sometimes watch a movie. I love my family very much. They make me happy and help me every day. I am lucky to have them in my life.
