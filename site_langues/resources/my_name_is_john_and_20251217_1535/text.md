## Text

My name is John, and I am 15 years old. I go to high school. My school is big and has many students. I have classes every weekday. My favorite subjects are math and science. I like my teachers because they are kind and helpful. During break time, I play soccer with my friends in the school yard. I also enjoy going to the library. It's a quiet place where I can read books. After school, I sometimes have club activities. I am in the music club. I play the guitar. School is fun because I learn new things every day.
