## Text

Christmas morning in the United Kingdom usually starts with an air of excitement, and for James, a fifteen-year-old living in Manchester, it was no different. As the first rays of light peeked through his curtains, he could barely contain his enthusiasm. He quickly hopped out of bed, donning his festive pajamas, and made his way to the living room, where the aroma of pine mingled with the spicy scent of cinnamon and cloves from the decorations his mother had meticulously arranged.

Traditionally, the family waits for everyone to gather before opening presents, a ritual that tests his patience. James's younger sister, Emily, was already there, bouncing with glee. Once everyone had settled with a cup of hot chocolate, the unwrapping began. The room soon filled with joyful laughter and gratitude, as brightly colored paper was torn away to reveal thoughtful gifts. James was thrilled to receive a new set of headphones, something he’d been hinting at for months.

The afternoon was spent indulging in delightful activities. The family took a brisk walk through the nearby park, a tradition that provided the perfect opportunity to savor the crisp, wintry air and appreciate the festive decorations around the neighborhood. Upon returning home, James helped his father in the kitchen, preparing the much-anticipated Christmas feast. The table was set extravagantly with a golden roast turkey, honey-glazed carrots, and all the traditional trimmings that James had come to associate with the holiday.

As evening descended, the family gathered around the fireplace, basking in the warm glow of the flames. They watched the Queen's Speech, an enduring tradition that prompted reflections on the year past and hopes for the future. The day concluded with board games and shared stories, strengthening family bonds. As James finally retreated to his room, he felt content, enveloped by the comforting sense of togetherness that Christmas unfailingly brings.
