## Text

The debate over whether smartphones should be banned in schools to enhance concentration and mental health is increasingly relevant. Proponents argue that these devices are a source of distraction, pulling students' attention away from educational tasks. The constant barrage of notifications and social media interactions can indeed hinder focus, making it difficult for students to engage deeply with their studies. Furthermore, smartphones may contribute to mental health issues, as they facilitate access to social media, which has been linked to anxiety and depression among teenagers.

Conversely, opponents of such bans highlight the potential educational benefits and the importance of teaching responsible smartphone usage. These devices can serve as powerful learning tools, offering access to educational apps and a wealth of information. Additionally, an outright ban might be perceived as overly restrictive, ignoring the role of technology in modern education.

Ultimately, a balanced approach might be more effective, where schools implement structured usage policies that encourage mindfulness and self-discipline, thereby fostering both concentration and mental well-being.
