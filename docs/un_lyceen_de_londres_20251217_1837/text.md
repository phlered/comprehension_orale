Hello! My name is Tom, and I am a high school student in London. I like to do many things in my free time. I love playing football with my friends in the park. It is fun and keeps me active. I also enjoy reading books, especially mysteries. They are exciting, and I always want to know what happens next.

I live with my family. My mum is a teacher, and my dad works in an office. I have a younger sister named Lily. She is ten years old and very funny. We have a pet dog named Max. He is big and very friendly.

London is a great city. My favorite place is the British Museum. I like to see all the old things and learn about history. I also love Hyde Park. It is a big park, and we can have picnics there. Sometimes, we go to the London Eye. The view of the city from the top is amazing!
