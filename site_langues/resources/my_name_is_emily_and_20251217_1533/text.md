## Text

My name is Emily and I am 16 years old. I am a student in high school. I want to tell you about my school life and my school experiences.

Every morning, I wake up at 7:00 AM. I eat breakfast and then go to school. I usually walk to school because it is close to my house. My school starts at 8:00 AM. I go to different classes like math, science, English, and history. My favorite subject is English because I like reading and writing stories.

During the break, I talk with my friends. We like to play games or eat snacks. My best friend's name is Sarah. We are in the same class, and we always help each other with homework.

In the afternoon, I have more classes. Sometimes, we have art or music, which are fun. I also enjoy physical education because I love sports. After school, I join the drama club. We are preparing a play for the school festival.

I go home around 4:00 PM. I do my homework and study for exams. I like to listen to music when I study. In the evening, I have dinner with my family. Then, I relax and watch TV or read a book.

I like my high school life because I learn new things and have fun with my friends. School is important to me, and I enjoy my time there.
