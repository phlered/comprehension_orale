## Text

The London Underground is a famous subway system. It opened in 1863, making it the oldest metro in the world. People often call it "the Tube" because of the shape of the tunnels. There are 11 lines, and they have different colors on the map. Every day, many people use the Tube to go to work, school, or visit places. It is a fast way to travel in London. Sometimes, the trains can be very crowded, especially during rush hour in the morning and evening. Each station has signs to help passengers find their way. If you visit London, riding the Tube is a great way to explore the city.
