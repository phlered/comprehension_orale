## Text

In 2025, the role of social media influencers as positive role models for teenagers remains a contentious issue, sparking both intrigue and skepticism. These digital trendsetters, previously celebrated for democratizing fame and providing diverse perspectives, are now scrutinized for their evolving influence on adolescent development. On one hand, influencers have become more conscious of the content they produce, often promoting mental health awareness, social justice, and sustainable living—an admirable shift towards positive advocacy. They wield substantial power in shaping values and norms and offer a window into a multitude of lifestyles and ideologies that might otherwise remain unexplored by young audiences.

However, the line between genuine inspiration and commercialization can blur, raising concerns about authenticity and the impact of consumerism. The incessant pursuit of likes and followers can perpetuate unrealistic standards, fostering detrimental comparisons among impressionable teens. As influencers navigate their influence, it is increasingly pivotal for educators and parents to foster media literacy in adolescents, guiding them to discern between constructive role models and those that might hinder their well-being.
