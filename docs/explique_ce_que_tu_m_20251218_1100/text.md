## Text

Hello! I want to tell you about what I eat in a day. In the morning, I have breakfast. I like to eat a bowl of cereal with milk. Sometimes, I eat toast with butter and jam. I also like to drink orange juice or a cup of tea.

At noon, it is time for lunch. I usually eat a sandwich with cheese and ham. I like to add some lettuce and tomato too. Sometimes, I eat a small salad with my sandwich. I drink water or a soda with lunch.

In the evening, I have dinner with my family. We eat different things each day. Sometimes, we have pasta with tomato sauce. Other times, we eat chicken with rice and vegetables. I like to drink water or a glass of milk with dinner.

After dinner, if I am still a little hungry, I might have a piece of fruit or a small cookie. Eating is fun and I enjoy my meals!
