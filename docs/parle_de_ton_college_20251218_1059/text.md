Hello! My name is Alex. I go to Greenfield School. It is a big school. I am in class 7B. Let me tell you about my school and my classes.

I study many subjects at school. I have Math, English, Science, and History. I also study Art and Music. We learn a lot every day.

My school day starts at 8:00 in the morning. I have four classes before lunch. We have a break at 10:00. Lunch is at 12:00, and it is one hour long. After lunch, we have two more classes. School ends at 3:00 in the afternoon.

My favorite subject is Science. It is very interesting. I like doing experiments. I also like our Science teacher. She is nice and helps us a lot.

I enjoy going to school and learning new things. I have many friends in my class. My school days are fun!
