## Text

On Sundays, I always look forward to having dinner with my grandma. It has become a cherished tradition in our family. Every week, my grandma prepares a delicious meal for us. Her house is filled with the wonderful aroma of home-cooked food as soon as we walk in.

Grandma usually starts cooking early in the morning. She loves making roast chicken with potatoes and fresh vegetables from her garden. Sometimes, she even bakes a pie for dessert. My favorite is her apple pie with cinnamon. It's hard to resist taking a slice before dinner!

During dinner, we gather around the big dining table. We chat about our week, share stories, and laugh together. My grandma often tells tales from her childhood, which we all enjoy hearing. Her stories make us appreciate the past and understand our family history better.

After dinner, we help grandma clean up the table and do the dishes. It's a small way to thank her for the delicious meal and the love she pours into every dish. Spending Sunday evenings with my grandma not only fills my stomach but also my heart. It’s a time for family bonding, creating memories that I will cherish forever.
