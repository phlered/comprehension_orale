## Text

Spending Christmas away from home for the first time can be a transformative experience, especially for a British teenager accustomed to traditional festivities. Sarah, a 16-year-old from a small town in Yorkshire, found herself on an unforeseen adventure last December. Her family had relocated to Italy for her father's job, and this Christmas was destined to be different from any she'd known.

Missing the familiar hustle and bustle of the local Christmas market, where she would usually help her mum pick out gifts and sip on spiced apple cider, Sarah felt a pang of homesickness. The prospect of celebrating without the customary turkey dinner and the Queen’s speech left her feeling somewhat disoriented. However, this unusual setting presented a unique opportunity to embrace new traditions.

In Italy, Christmas festivities are vibrant and filled with longstanding customs that intrigued Sarah. On Christmas Eve, she joined her new Italian friends for a feast known as “La Vigilia.” The table was brimming with an array of seafood dishes, an unexpected but delightful change from her usual holiday meals. The atmosphere was filled with warmth, laughter, and the harmonious melodies of Italian carols, which added a touch of magic to the evening.

Christmas Day was equally enchanting. Instead of opening presents early in the morning as she was used to, Sarah attended a midnight mass at the local church. The grandeur and solemnity of the service, combined with the exquisite nativity scenes scattered throughout the town, imbued her with a profound sense of peace and joy.

The experience taught Sarah that while she dearly missed her home and family traditions, there was beauty in adaptation and growth. Celebrating her first Christmas away from home was not just about dealing with absence but embracing the presence of new experiences. This holiday became a cherished memory, one that broadened her perspective and enriched her understanding of the world around her.
