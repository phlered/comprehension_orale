## Text

I go to the grocery store with my mom. We go every Saturday morning. The grocery store is big. It has many things. We need a cart to carry our food. First, we go to the fruit section. We buy apples, bananas, and oranges. They are fresh and sweet.

Next, we go to the vegetable section. We buy carrots, tomatoes, and lettuce. My mom likes to make salad. Then, we go to the bread section. We buy a loaf of bread. It smells good. We also buy milk and eggs in the dairy section.

My little brother loves cookies, so we get a box of cookies, too. Finally, we go to the cashier. She is nice and smiles at us. We pay for the food and leave the store. Going to the grocery store is fun. We have many good things to eat at home now.
