## Text

My name is Emily, and I am 16 years old. I go to high school. My high school is big and has many students. Every day, I wake up at 7 a.m. and get ready for school. My classes start at 8 a.m. I study different subjects like math, English, science, and history. My favorite subject is English because I like to read and write stories.

During break time, I spend time with my friends. We talk, laugh, and sometimes share snacks. We often discuss our favorite TV shows and music. I like listening to pop music.

I also enjoy sports. I am on the school basketball team. We practice three times a week. Playing basketball is fun, and it helps me stay fit. We sometimes have matches with other schools. Winning a game makes me feel proud.

After school, I do my homework. It usually takes me about two hours. Sometimes, I find math difficult, but I try my best to understand. When I finish my homework, I relax by watching movies or reading books.

I like my school because I learn new things every day. My teachers are nice and helpful. I feel happy when I am at school with my friends. High school is an important part of my life, and I enjoy it very much.
