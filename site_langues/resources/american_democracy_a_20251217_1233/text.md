## Text

American democracy is a system that values the participation of its citizens. Every four years, Americans vote in presidential elections to choose their leader. Before the election, candidates from different political parties, mainly the Republicans and Democrats, campaign across the country. They participate in debates and share their ideas on important issues like healthcare, education, and the economy. 

The process begins with primary elections, where each party selects its candidate. In November, citizens vote on Election Day. However, Americans don't directly vote for the president. Instead, they vote for electors in the Electoral College. This system can sometimes be confusing, but it is designed to balance the power between big and small states. Overall, American elections are a vital part of democracy, allowing people to express their opinions and influence the country's future.
