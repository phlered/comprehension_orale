For lunch, I eat a sandwich. I put ham and cheese inside. Sometimes, I add lettuce. Sandwiches are easy to make.

At night, my family eats dinner. We eat rice and chicken often. Rice is white and soft. Chicken is juicy and nice. We also eat vegetables like carrots and peas.

Sometimes, we have dessert. Dessert is sweet. Ice cream is my favorite dessert. It is cold and comes in many flavors. I like chocolate ice cream the most. 

Food makes me happy!
