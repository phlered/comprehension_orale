## Text

Hello! My name is Tom, and I am from Devon, in the United Kingdom. Devon is a beautiful place in the countryside. I live in a small village with my family. My family is not very big. I have a sister and a brother. My sister’s name is Emily. She is 10 years old and loves to read books. My brother is Jack. He is 8 years old and likes to play football.

I enjoy spending time outside. I have a few hobbies. I love hiking and exploring the hills near my home. The air is fresh and the views are amazing. I also like cycling. Sometimes, I ride my bike to the nearby town to buy snacks.

At home, we have three chickens, and we get fresh eggs every day. We also have a dog named Max. He is very friendly and loves to play. Living in the countryside is nice because it is calm and quiet. I really like my life in Devon.
