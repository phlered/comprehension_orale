## Text

The first rays of dawn crept into Oliver's room as his alarm buzzed to signal the start of Christmas Day. Despite the chill of the December morning, he leaped out of bed, fueled by a mix of excitement and the comforting aroma of pine and fresh-baked pastries that wafted up from downstairs. As tradition dictated, his family began the day with a hearty breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon, and cinnamon rolls, their warm, spicy sweetness setting a festive tone.

Following breakfast, Oliver and his family gathered around their grand, tinsel-draped tree in the living room, a yearly ritual he cherished. Wrapped gifts glimmered beneath the tree, each one adorned with colorful paper and hastily-tied bows. Oliver's younger sister, Lucy, eagerly handed out presents, her eyes shining with anticipation. As the hours passed with the exchange of gifts and joyful laughter, Oliver found himself appreciating not just the tangible offerings but the shared moments that genuinely marked the season's essence.

By midday, the house was filled with the succulent aroma of the traditional Christmas lunch. The feast was a sight to behold: a golden, roasted turkey surrounded by all the trimmings—crispy roast potatoes, buttered carrots, and a generous jug of gravy. As they sat down to eat, Oliver’s grandfather regaled everyone with tales of Christmases past, a narrative interwoven with humorous anecdotes and heartfelt memories.

The afternoon was spent in a delightful haze of games, chatter, and a brisk walk through the frost-laden countryside that surrounded their village. The cold wind on his cheeks and the crunch of snow underfoot created a picture-perfect setting, enhancing the magic of the day.

As evening descended, the family gathered once more around a roaring fire, indulging in slices of rich Christmas pudding and steaming cups of cocoa. Reflecting on the day's events, Oliver felt a profound sense of gratitude and contentment, recognizing that Christmas was not just a day of giving, but a celebration of love, family, and cherished traditions.
