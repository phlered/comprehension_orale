Hello!

My name is Emily and I am from the United States. I live in a small town in the Midwest. I am excited to be your pen pal! Let me tell you a little about myself.

I am 15 years old and I have a big family. I have two brothers and one sister. We also have a dog named Max. My family is very important to me. We often spend time together. We like to watch movies on weekends.

In my free time, I enjoy reading books. My favorite books are adventure stories. I also like to draw and paint. Art is my favorite subject in school. Sometimes, I play the guitar. I am still learning, but it is fun!

Living in a rural area is nice. I like that it is quiet and we have lots of nature around. There are many beautiful fields and trees. However, there are not many shops or places to go. Sometimes, I wish there were more activities to do.

But, I love the community here. People are friendly and everyone knows each other. I feel safe and happy in my town. I hope to hear about your life too!

Best wishes,

Emily
