Hello! My name is Emily, and I am a high school student in New York City. I have a few hobbies that I really enjoy. I love playing the guitar. Every weekend, I practice for a few hours. Music makes me happy. I also like reading books. My favorite books are adventure stories.

I live with my family in a small apartment. My family is very important to me. I have one brother, and he is younger than me. He is very funny, and we like watching movies together. My mom is a teacher, and my dad works in an office. They are very supportive and kind.

New York City is an exciting place. I love walking in Central Park. It is so big and green. I also enjoy visiting museums because I like learning new things. My favorite museum is the American Museum of Natural History. The city is busy, but there is always something fun to do. I feel lucky to live here.
