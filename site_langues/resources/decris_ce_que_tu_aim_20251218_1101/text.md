## Text

My name is Anna. I want to tell you about what I like and what I do not like. I like sports. My favorite sport is soccer. I play soccer with my friends after school. It is fun and good exercise. I also like basketball. I watch basketball games on TV.

I like music, too. I listen to music every day. My favorite music is pop music. I like to dance when I hear pop songs. My favorite singer is Taylor Swift. Her songs make me happy.

In school, I like some subjects, but not all. I like English and art. English is interesting because I learn to read and write. Art is fun because I can draw and paint. I do not like math. It is hard for me. I also do not like history. It is not my favorite because it is difficult to remember dates.

These are my likes and dislikes. What about you?
