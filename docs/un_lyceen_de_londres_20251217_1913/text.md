Hello! My name is Tom and I am a high school student in London. I want to tell you about my hobbies, my family, and my favorite places in my city.

I have many hobbies. I love playing football with my friends in the park. We play every Saturday. It is very fun and good exercise. I also like listening to music. My favorite band is Coldplay. Their songs are amazing! I often listen to them when I do my homework.

I have a small family. I live with my parents and my little sister. My sister's name is Anna and she is 10 years old. She is very funny and we like to watch movies together. My parents work in the city. My mom is a teacher and my dad is an engineer.

London is a big and interesting city. My favorite place is Hyde Park. It is very beautiful and I like to walk there. I also love the London Eye. The view from the top is fantastic!

Thank you for reading about my life in London!
